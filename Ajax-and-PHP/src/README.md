# Ajax-and-PHP

In this repository you will find some projects that I have done in order to learn more about how to use ajax call in php !

I used ajax call in different circumstances by implementing it in :

- `likes` and `unlikes` button (hearts button) in blogs
- Forms
- Infinite scrolling
- Google Api, rendering the address when passing a zipcode to the searchbar.
